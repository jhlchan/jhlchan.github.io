<h1>Turtle Graphics</br>
<small><small>using Python</small></small></h1>

We shall take a look at programming, having fun.
<p>

<h2>Computer Programming</h2>
Computers are machines. They perform tasks by instructions:
<ul>
<li>How to put together instructions is called <b>programming</b>,</li>
<li>To write down the instructions require a <b>programming language</b>.</li>
</ul>
In short, we need a programming language to instruct computers to work.
<p>
Like human languages, there are many programming languages. However, ideas are the same: every language can express numbers (1, 2, 3), characters ('a', 'b', 'c'), strings ("apple", "orange"), and others to represent data.
<p>
Programming languages are used to express programming ideas:
<ul>
<li>data of various types: numbers, strings, etc.</li>
<li>symbols for variables: place-holder for data.</li>
<li>instructions sequencing: going step-by-step.</li>
<li>instructions branching: decide by a test.</li>
<li>instructions looping: control by counter or exit test.</li>
<li>instructions grouping into a function, with parameters.</li>
<li>function grouping into a program.</li>
<li>program grouping into a module.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Python in Browser</h2>
For a demonstration, we shall use a version of Python【1】running in a browser.
<p>
Once the webpage is loaded, you'll find an editor on the left, and a drawing board (also called the canvas) on the right.
The editor may have a program loaded, in an editor tab called main.py. The drawing board shows the result of running the program.
<p>
We shall begin with a clean sheet, so clear the program on the left. Move the cursor along the top, click dropdowns (▽) to be familiar with the buttons.

<h2>Making a Turtle</h2>
Start by typing this line:
<pre>
import turtle
</pre>
This loads the module turtle, some codes written by a team so that we can make use of it to draw graphics. We name our little turtle bob, and create it by invoking the contructor Turtle():
<pre>
bob = turtle.Turtle()
</pre>
So far we have two lines. If you 'run' this program (the button ▷), there is nothing shown on the drawing board. Now add these two lines:
<pre>
bob.shape("turtle")
bob.speed(10)
</pre>
Click 'run' again, and bob appears on the drawing board!
<p>
So far, there are 4 lines for the program. We can add comments in Python, prefix by #, to explain what they are doing:
<pre>
import turtle          # load module
bob = turtle.Turtle()  # construct turtle instance

bob.shape("turtle")    # give bob a shape
bob.speed(10)          # set speed for bob
</pre>
We shall type more lines later, but these 4 lines will stay.

<h2>Moving a Turtle</h2>
Now bob is an object, let us make bob move. Any turtle can respond to certain methods:
<ul>
<li>fd(steps) to go forward by a number of steps,</li>
<li>lt(degrees) to do a left turn by a number of degrees,</li>
<li>bd(steps) to go backwards by a number of steps,</li>
<li>rt(degrees) to do a right turn by a number of degrees,</li>
</ul>
To make an object respond to a method, put them together with a dot '.' as connective.
Try these three lines:
<pre>
bob.fd(100)
bob.lt(90)
bob.fd(100)
</pre>
Click 'run' and see how bob moves. Now replace these 3 lines by:
<pre>
for j in range(4):
   bob.fd(100)
   bob.lt(90)
</pre>
Note the indentation, which is required for Python. Run and bob will draw a square. Can you see why?
<p>
The above is a Python for-loop, with range(4) giving the list [0, 1, 2, 3]. The index j takes each value of the list, successively.
The effect of this for-loop is to repeat the indented body 4 times. Each time the body code runs, bob moves forward and makes a left right-angle turn. This draws one side of a square. Repeating 4 times draws the complete square. 

<h2>Using a Function</h2>
Now bob can draw a square, but we would like bob to draw many squares. Surely, we don't want to retype the square for-loop again and again. To simplify the work, we shall use a function.
<p>
In math, a function looks like this: f(x) = 2 &#8270; x + 3. The function has a name f, and works on a variable x. The variable x is the input, and f(x) gives the formula for the output. A function can have more variables. For example, g(x,y) = 2 &#8270; x + 3 &#8270; y. The important idea of a function is: variables are input, the function formula gives output.
<p>
In programming, a function also has a name, with input variables called parameters, and the formula is replaced by a body of instructions, giving output action. The parameters, like variables, are symbols to be substituted in the body to produce specific actions. Let's see this in Python.
<p>
Remove the for-loop, and define a drawSquare function, with turtle and size as parameters:
<pre>
# draw square for turtle, with size
def drawSquare(turtle, size):
   for j in range(4):
      turtle.fd(size)
      turtle.lt(90)
</pre>
In Python, <b>def</b> is the keyword to signify the definition of a function. After specifying the name with parameters in brackets, a colon (:) terminates this declaration. This is followed by an indented body of the definition, which is the previous for-loop, but using the parameter turtle instead of bob. The forward movement takes the parameter size, so that drawSquare(turtle, size) can be applied to any turtle and draws a square of any size.
<p>
After typing in this definition, add a blank line, and invoke it by this line:
<pre>
drawSquare(bob, 100)
</pre>
This means drawSquare(turtle, size) is applied with actual parameters turtle = bob, and size = 100. Run this code, and surely bob draws the same square. Change this line to:
<pre>
drawSquare(bob, 150)
</pre>
and bob draws a bigger square. We can go on to teach bob to draw a picture building from squares. Before we do that, we would like to convert this function to a method for the object.

<h2>Using a Method</h2>
Recall that the turtle bob is an object. An object responds to its methods. For example, bob.fd(100) means bob responds to the method forward, with a step size 100. Therefore, methods are functions attached to an object, for an object to respond to.
<p>
Wouldn't it be nice if we can write bob.square(100), so that bob can respond to a method with step size 100, by itself? Maybe we can teach bob other methods, so that eventually bob can respond and draw a beautiful picture for us!
<p>
In Python, there are several ways to do this. One way is to reuse our code drawSquare:
<pre>
# cast method for object
bob.square = drawSquare.__get__(bob)
</pre>
Remove the line 'drawSquare(bob, 150)', and type in the lines above.
The line means we set a method square for bob, which is the function drawSquare with the first parameter turtle substituted by bob. Thus bob.square needs only 1 parameter, the size of the square.
We can test this by:
<pre>
bob.square(100)
</pre>
Run it, and now bob draws a square by itself, responding to its own method.

<h2>Compose a Picture</h2>
Comment out the test 'bob.square(100)' by inserting a # at the very start.
Type in the following lines, and see if you can imagine what a turtle will draw as a result:
<pre>
# draw a picture
def drawPicture(turtle, size):
   for j in range(36):
      turtle.square(size)
      turtle.lt(10)
</pre>
The body of the for-loop tell a turtle to draw a square, then turn left by 10 degrees. The for-loop will repeat the body 36 times, thus the turtle will turn 36 &#8270; 10 = 360 degrees, a full circle. Can you figure out the final picture?
<p>
Before we test this, we can convert this function into a method by the same trick above:
<pre>
# cast method for object
bob.picture = drawPicture.__get__(bob)
</pre>
Now we test this by running:
<pre>
bob.picture(100)
</pre>
Does the picture match what you expect?

<!--

<h2>Turtle Documentation</h2>
The turtle bob is an object, and it responds to methods of two types:
<ul>
<li>built-in methods: like shape(type), speed(value), fd(step), lt(degree), etc.</li>
<li>user-defined methods: like square(size), picture(size).</li>
</ul>
To find out all methods attached to object bob, first we need to run our code in the console mode.
This is achieved by clicking the drop-down ▽ (next to ▷), and choose 'Console', and the icon for 'run' changes to that of the console. Meanwhile, you can read some output in another window, ending with:
<span style="color:green">
<pre>
>>>
</pre>
</span>
This shows up in color green, and represents the console prompt, waiting for some input text here.
Now if you place the cursor after the green prompt, and type:
<pre>
dir(bob)
</pre>
The console window will give the following output (you can resize the console window):
<pre>
>>> dir(bob)
['__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__get__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__',
 '__init__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__repr__',
 '__setattr__', '__str__', 'back', 'backward', 'begin_fill', 'bk', 'circle', 'clear',
 'clone', 'color', 'degrees', 'delay', 'distance', 'done', 'dot', 'down', 'end_fill',
 'fd', 'fill', 'fillcolor', 'forward', 'getpen', 'getscreen', 'getturtle', 'heading',
 'hideturtle', 'home', 'ht', 'isdown', 'isvisible', 'left', 'lt', 'mainloop', 'onclick',
 'ondrag', 'onrelease', 'pd', 'pencolor', 'pendown', 'pensize', 'penup', 'picture',
 'pos', 'position', 'pu', 'radians', 'reset', 'right', 'rt', 'seth', 'setheading',
 'setpos', 'setposition', 'setundobuffer', 'setx', 'sety', 'shape', 'showturtle',
 'speed', 'square', 'st', 'stamp', 'towards', 'tracer', 'undo', 'undobufferentries',
 'up', 'update', 'width', 'window_height', 'window_width', 'write', 'xcor', 'ycor']
</pre>
The command <b>dir</b> gives the directory of object bob. The output is a list of methods known to bob.
Only picture and square are user-defined methods, all others are built-in methods.
There are some method aliases: fd as forward, lt as left, bk as back and backwards, rt as right, etc.
<p>
If you examine the build-in methods for bob, there is this one: circle. To find out its parameter, we need to check out the full documentation of the module turtle.
<p>
Click the question mark "?" button (next to ▽) for a list of available modules for Trinkets Python, in a new tab.
Click "turtle" to find a list of built-in methods for turtles, with details.
Locate the method circle, and find its signature circle(radius) -- ignore the optional arguments for now.
<p>
Scroll down a bit to find also the method color, and some examples of using it.
<p>
Back to the Python tab, we can change the drawPicture code by commenting out a line, and inserting another line:
<pre>
      # turtle.square(size)
      turtle.circle(size)
</pre>
Also, add this line before 'bob.picture(100)', so that they become:
<pre>
bob.color('pink')
bob.picture(100)
</pre>
If you have resized the console window, resize it again to as low as possible.
Now change the 'Console' back to just 'Run' using the drop-down ▽, and see the result on the drawing board. Isn't that beautiful?

<h2>Python Thinking</h2>
Flip to the Documentation tab, and find a big blue button 'Example'.
Click it for a demo. See the picture on the right.
Now read the Python code on the left. You should be able to figure out how the picture is produced.
